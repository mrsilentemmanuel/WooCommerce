# Problem and Solution
The company offers free shipping on orders over $59 per address. So, that means that if someone orders lets say $110 worth of merchandise that is being sent to two addresses, they would only receive the free shipping on One address and not both. That said if the order was for $121 then both address would receive the free shipping. BUT a address has to have at least $59 worth of products in order to get free shipping. So, for example, let's say a person has a order for $70 shipping to two seperate address, with $24 going to address 1 and $46 going to address 2 they would not receive any free shipping on either address.

Added logic to the multiple shipping address using a PHP Function.
